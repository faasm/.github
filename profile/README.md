# Faasm Ecosystem

Faasm is a research project on serverless runtimes. Faasm originated in the
[Large-Scale Data & Systems](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/faasm) group
from the Imperial College London, but has contributors and collaborators
among other institutions.

## Faasm Projects

* [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm) is a high-performance serverless
runtime using WebAssembly for function isolation.
* [Faabric](https://github.com/faasm/faabric) is a messaging and state layer
for distributed serverless applications
* [TLess](https://github.com/faasm/tless) is a confidential serverless
runtime based on Faasm.
