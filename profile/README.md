# Faasm Ecosystem

Faasm is a research project on distributed serverless runtimes with WebAssembly
(WASM). Faasm originated in the [Large-Scale Data & Systems](
https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/faasm) group from the Imperial College London, 
but has contributors and collaborators among other institutions.

## Faasm Projects

* [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm) is a high-performance serverless
runtime using WebAssembly for function isolation.
* [Faabric](https://github.com/faasm/faabric) is a messaging and state layer
for distributed serverless applications.
