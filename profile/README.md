# Faasm Ecosystem

Faasm is a research project on serverless runtimes. Faasm originated in the
Large-Scale Data & Systems group from the Imperial College London, but has
contributors and collaborators among other institutions.

## Faasm Projects

* [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm) is a high-performance serverless
runtime using WebAssembly for function isolation.
* [Faabric](https://github.com/faasm/faabric) is a messaging and state layer
for distributed serverless applications

## Research Dissemination

* [ATC 2020 - Faasm: Lightweight Isolation for Efficient Stateful Serverless
Computing](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/shillaker)
